/* __ieee754_sqrt(x)
 * Return correctly rounded sqrt.
 *           ------------------------------------------
 *	     |  Use the hardware sqrt if you have one |
 *           ------------------------------------------
 * Method: 
 *   Bit by bit method using integer arithmetic. (Slow, but portable) 
 *   1. Normalization
 *	Scale x to y in [1,4) with even powers of 2: 
 *	find an integer k such that  1 <= (y=x*2^(2k)) < 4, then
 *		sqrt(x) = 2^k * sqrt(y)
 *   2. Bit by bit computation
 *	Let q  = sqrt(y) truncated to i bit after binary point (q = 1),
 *	     i							 0
 *                                     i+1         2
 *	    s  = 2*q , and	y  =  2   * ( y - q  ).		(1)
 *	     i      i            i                 i
 *                                                        
 *	To compute q    from q , one checks whether 
 *		    i+1       i                       
 *
 *			      -(i+1) 2
 *			(q + 2      ) <= y.			(2)
 *     			  i
 *							      -(i+1)
 *	If (2) is false, then q   = q ; otherwise q   = q  + 2      .
 *		 	       i+1   i             i+1   i
 *
 *	With some algebric manipulation, it is not difficult to see
 *	that (2) is equivalent to 
 *                             -(i+1)
 *			s  +  2       <= y			(3)
 *			 i                i
 *
 *	The advantage of (3) is that s  and y  can be computed by 
 *				      i      i
 *	the following recurrence formula:
 *	    if (3) is false
 *
 *	    s     =  s  ,	y    = y   ;			(4)
 *	     i+1      i		 i+1    i
 *
 *	    otherwise,
 *                         -i                     -(i+1)
 *	    s	  =  s  + 2  ,  y    = y  -  s  - 2  		(5)
 *           i+1      i          i+1    i     i
 *				
 *	One may easily use induction to prove (4) and (5). 
 *	Note. Since the left hand side of (3) contain only i+2 bits,
 *	      it does not necessary to do a full (53-bit) comparison 
 *	      in (3).
 *   3. Final rounding
 *	After generating the 53 bits result, we compute one more bit.
 *	Together with the remainder, we can decide whether the
 *	result is exact, bigger than 1/2ulp, or less than 1/2ulp
 *	(it will never equal to 1/2ulp).
 *	The rounding mode can be detected by checking whether
 *	huge + tiny is equal to huge, and whether huge - tiny is
 *	equal to huge for some floating point number "huge" and "tiny".
 *		
 * Special cases:
 *	sqrt(+-0) = +-0 	... exact
 *	sqrt(inf) = inf
 *	sqrt(-ve) = NaN		... with invalid signal
 *	sqrt(NaN) = NaN		... with invalid signal for signaling NaN
 *
 * Other methods : see the appended file at the end of the program below.
